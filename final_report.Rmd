## Motivation
Liver transplantation is a life-saving therapy for patients with end-stage liver disease, and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (ALD) has become one of its leading indications in the United States. As ALD-related morbidity and mortality continue to rise, understanding patterns in transplant access, candidate characteristics, and post-transplant outcomes has become increasingly important. 

In this website, we provide an overview of key aspects of liver transplantation with a focus on ALD, highlighting trends in candidate demographics, transplant rates, and post-transplant outcomes. Our goal is to offer an accessible, data-driven perspective on the evolving role of ALD in liver transplantation.


## Related Work
We were inspired to perform this analysis after discovering data from the SRTR database. SRTR's primary source of data is the [Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/). The SRTR database consists of many data tables with many components, including data on the transplant waiting lists, the donor/recipient matching process, deceased donors, living donors, and transplant recipients.  The data dictionary with all available variables can be found [here](https://www.srtr.org/requesting-srtr-data/saf-data-dictionary/).

## Initial Questions
We began by exploring the dataset and available variables to investigate changes in the transplant landscape over time. We focused on those listed with alcohol-related liver disease given the recent increases in alcohol use in the United States and given that it is now the leading indication for liver transplantation. We decided to break down the questions we asked into 3 key questions:

1. What are some of the outcomes when placed on the waitlist for an organ?

2. What are some of the characteristics of the organ recipients?

3. What are some of the characteristics of the organ donors?


## Evolution of Questions
As our project evolved, we delved into more in-depth questions:

1. Does sex impact waitlist mortality?
2. What are the donor and recipient demographics and do donors frequently match recipients in age and race?
3. Does the donor type impact patient recipient outcomes?
4. For recipients who experienced graft failure, is there a difference in the time to graft failure based on donor type?
5. Among transplants with graft failure, what is the distribution of patients who received multi-organ transplants compared to single organ liver transplants?

## Data
We used two of the large datafiles available:

- `CAND_LIIN` includes persons who are registered on the OPTN waiting list and presents information about candidates during the time they are waiting to receive an organ.

- `TX_LI` includes characteristics of the patient at the time of transplant and the transplant operation itself. 

The data was cleaned using RStudio/RMarkdown to meet the following criteria:

- Every observation required a unique identifier (`PERS_ID`).

- All patients had to be over the age of 18 age (`CAN_AGE_AT_LISTING` and `REC_AGE_AT_TX` >= 18)

- Dates must be saved in correct date format (`REC_TX_DT`, `CAN_LISTING_DT`)

- Only patients with an alcohol-related diagnosis code were included. Those with alcohol-related cirrhosis had `CAN_DGN` 4215, 4216 and those with acute-alcohol related hepatitis had `CAN_DGN` 4217.

- Evaluation or transplant should have occurred after the year 2020. We chose this time cut off because this is when liver transplants for a severe form of alcohol-related liver disease termed alcohol-related hepatitis, were first introduced. (`REC_TX_DT`, `CAN_LISTING_DT` >= 2020).

## Exploratory Analysis

Demographic and clinical characteristics at listing—including age, MELD score, race/ethnicity, and diagnostic subtype—were summarized overall and stratified by sex. Additional subgroup tables describe individuals separately with alcohol-related cirrhosis and acute alcohol-related hepatitis. Continuous variables are reported using medians and interquartile ranges, and categorical variables using frequencies and percentages. These tables illustrate differences in listing severity, demographic composition, and raw waitlist mortality across clinical subgroups. Group comparisons in descriptive tables were assessed using non-parametric tests for continuous variables and χ²-based methods for categorical variables, with p-values provided to summarize evidence of between-group differences. T

Kaplan–Meier curves were generated to compare waitlist survival between men and women. Each curve reflects time from listing to waitlist death, with censoring at transplant, administrative removal, or end of follow-up. Confidence bands depict uncertainty in the estimated survival probabilities, and log-rank testing evaluates whether survival differs by sex. These plots summarize the cumulative risk of waitlist mortality over time and highlight potential sex-based disparities.

In addition to clinical characteristics and waitlist outcomes, demographic patterns of transplanted donor–recipient pairs were examined to explore factors that may influence equity in transplant access. Age distribution visualizations showed that recipients tended to be older than their donors, with recipients displaying a narrower age range. Living donor transplants demonstrated slightly larger donor–recipient age gaps than deceased donor transplants, reflecting greater reliance on younger family members as donors.

Recipient patient outcomes were also observed using the incidence of graft failures and last follow-up patient status. Across transplants with living donors and deceased donors, there was a similar distribution of each category of patient status. A subsample of the ALD cohort was created to identify transplants with graft failure. The time to graft failure was computed from the difference in days between the transplant date and graft failure date. This graft failure subsample was stratified by donor type and also by transplant type.  

Racial distribution analyses revealed that both donor sources and transplant recipients remain predominantly White, with racial minority groups—including Black/African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander patients—representing substantially smaller proportions of transplant activity. A donor–recipient race matching matrix, heat map, further illustrated that exact race-matching is most frequent among White and Black/African American pairs, while opportunities for matched transplantation are limited among smaller minority racial groups. Together, these demographic findings highlight systemic disparities that may influence transplant eligibility, donor matching, and ultimately access to life-saving treatment.

## Limitations
Below we have outlined a few limitations in our analysis:
- *Limited capture of social determinants of health*: Key factors known to influence transplant access and outcomes—such as socioeconomic status, education, social support, and structural barriers to care—are not comprehensively represented in the dataset. As a result, we are unable to assess the role of social inequities in access to transplant and recovery.

- *Incomplete and inconsistently reported data*: As we originally perused the data sets, we noted that several variables contained missing or the values were not recorded in the data dictionary, particularly in race, cause-of-death, and donor mechanism-of-death fields. This may introduce classification uncertainty and reduce statistical power in subgroup comparisons. 

- *Cross-sectional nature of donor–recipient matching metrics*: These analyses that describe demographic matching rely on observed donor–recipient pairs. Therefore, they do not capture the underlying pool of available organs or candidates at match-run time, limiting inference regarding access disparities.


## Discussion
What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?

Our exploratory analyses provides context regarding the demographic landscape of liver transplantation in the United States for patients suffering from Alcohol-related Cirrhosis or Acute Alcohol-related Hepatitis. Recipients tended to be older than donors, reflecting the progression of liver disease to the point of transplantation and the younger age at which donor death or living donor eligibility typically occurs. Racial distribution plots showed that White individuals comprise the majority of both the donor and recipient populations, while minority racial groups remain underrepresented. The donor–recipient race matching heatmap further illustrated that match likelihood is highest among White and Black/African American individuals but substantially lower for other racial groups. These findings suggest that disparities in donor availability may reinforce inequities in transplant access for historically marginalized populations.

The ALD cohort shows demographic and clinical differences by sex, with women listed at younger ages and with slightly higher MELD scores, particularly in alcohol-related cirrhosis. Despite these baseline differences, waitlist mortality did not differ between men and women in either cirrhosis or acute alcohol-related hepatitis. This suggests that sex-based disparities in disease severity at listing do not translate into short-term differences in mortality risk after listing.

Among the graft failure subsample, that there was a lower proportion of multi-organ transplants than single-organ transplants. There were no multi-organ transplants from living donors that experienced graft failure. Analysis of the time between the transplant and graft failure revealed that the median time to graft failure for deceased donor transplants was greater than the median time for living donor transplants.

Our results align with expectations that clinical urgency drives listing and waitlist survival outcomes, but they also highlight structural demographic constraints that extend beyond clinical severity. The observation that sex-based clinical differences at listing do not translate into mortality differences suggests relative equity in waitlist management practices. However, the persistent demographic imbalance in who ultimately receives a transplant underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to improve donor recruitment and organ allocation policies that support equitable access across racial and demographic groups.
