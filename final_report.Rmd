## Motivation
Liver transplantation is a life-saving therapy for patients with end-stage liver disease, and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (ALD) has become one of its leading indications in the United States. As ALD-related morbidity and mortality continue to rise, understanding patterns in transplant access, candidate characteristics, and post-transplant outcomes has become increasingly important. 

In this website, we provide an overview of key aspects of liver transplantation with a focus on ALD, highlighting trends in candidate demographics, transplant rates, and post-transplant outcomes. Our goal is to offer an accessible, data-driven perspective on the evolving role of ALD in liver transplantation.


## Related Work
We were inspired to perform this analysis after discovering data from the SRTR database. SRTR's primary source of data is the [Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/). The SRTR database consists of many data tables with many components, including data on the transplant waiting lists, the donor/recipient matching process, deceased donors, living donors, and transplant recipients.  The data dictionary with all available variables can be found [here](https://www.srtr.org/requesting-srtr-data/saf-data-dictionary/).

## Initial Questions
We began by exploring the dataset and available variables to investigate changes in the transplant landscape over time. We focused on those listed with alcohol-related liver disease given the recent increases in alcohol use in the United States and given that it is now the leading indication for liver transplantation. We decided to break down the questions we asked into 3 key questions:

1. What are some of the outcomes when placed on the waitlist for an organ?

2. What are some of the characteristics of the organ recipients?

3. What are some of the characteristics of the organ donors?

## Evolution of Questions
As our project evolved, we delved into more in-depth questions:

1. Does sex impact waitlist mortality?
2. ***

## Data
We used two of the large datafiles available:

- `CAND_LIIN` includes persons who are registered on the OPTN waiting list and presents information about candidates during the time they are waiting to receive an organ.

- `TX_LI` includes characteristics of the patient at the time of transplant and the transplant operation itself. 

The data was cleaned using RStudio/RMarkdown to meet the following criteria:

- Every observation required a unique identifier (`PERS_ID`).

- All patients had to be over the age of 18 age (`CAN_AGE_AT_LISTING` and `REC_AGE_AT_TX` >= 18)

- Dates must be saved in correct date format (`REC_TX_DT`, `CAN_LISTING_DT`)

- Only patients with an alcohol-related diagnosis code were included. Those with alcohol-related cirrhosis had `CAN_DGN` 4215, 4216 and those with acute-alcohol related hepatitis had `CAN_DGN` 4217.

- Evaluation or transplant should have occurred after the year 2020. We chose this time cut off because this is when liver transplants for a severe form of alcohol-related liver disease termed alcohol-related hepatitis, were first introduced. (`REC_TX_DT`, `CAN_LISTING_DT` >= 2020).

## Exploratory Analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics at listing—including age, MELD score, race/ethnicity, and diagnostic subtype—were summarized overall and stratified by sex. Additional subgroup tables describe individuals separately with alcohol-related cirrhosis and acute alcohol-related hepatitis. Continuous variables are reported using medians and interquartile ranges, and categorical variables using frequencies and percentages. These tables illustrate differences in listing severity, demographic composition, and raw waitlist mortality across clinical subgroups. Group comparisons in descriptive tables were assessed using non-parametric tests for continuous variables and χ²-based methods for categorical variables, with p-values provided to summarize evidence of between-group differences. T


Kaplan–Meier curves were generated to compare waitlist survival between men and women. Each curve reflects time from listing to waitlist death, with censoring at transplant, administrative removal, or end of follow-up. Confidence bands depict uncertainty in the estimated survival probabilities, and log-rank testing evaluates whether survival differs by sex. These plots summarize the cumulative risk of waitlist mortality over time and highlight potential sex-based disparities.


## Limitations
- Limited social determinants and social factors are captured 
- Some of the data is incomplete

## Discussion
What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?

The ALD cohort shows demographic and clinical differences by sex, with women listed at younger ages and with slightly higher MELD scores, particularly in alcohol-related cirrhosis. Despite these baseline differences, waitlist mortality did not differ between men and women in either cirrhosis or acute alcohol-related hepatitis. This suggests that sex-based disparities in disease severity at listing do not translate into short-term differences in mortality risk after listing.
