# Liver Transplants
Liver transplantation is a life-saving therapy for patients with end-stage liver disease, and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (ALD) has become one of its leading indications in the United States. As ALD-related morbidity and mortality continue to rise, understanding patterns in transplant access, candidate characteristics, and post-transplant outcomes has become increasingly important.

Our project uses data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), a national registry that captures detailed information on all transplant candidates, recipients, and donors in the U.S. The dataset includes demographic variables, clinical severity measures, transplant events, and outcomes, allowing for comprehensive evaluation of the transplant landscape.

In this website, we provide an overview of key aspects of liver transplantation with a focus on ALD, highlighting trends in candidate demographics, transplant rates, and post-transplant outcomes. Our goal is to offer an accessible, data-driven perspective on the evolving role of ALD in liver transplantation.
