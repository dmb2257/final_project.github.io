<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Liver transplantation is a life-saving therapy for patients with
end-stage liver disease, and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (ALD) has
become one of its leading indications in the United States. As
ALD-related morbidity and mortality continue to rise, understanding how
ALD shapes waitlist dynamics, transplant access, and post-transplant
outcomes has become increasingly important.</p>
<p>In this website, we provide an overview of key aspects of liver
transplantation with a focus on ALD, highlighting trends in candidate
demographics, transplant rates, and post-transplant outcomes. Our goal
is to offer an accessible, data-driven perspective on the evolving role
of ALD in liver transplantation.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>We were inspired to perform this analysis after discovering data from
the SRTR database. SRTR’s primary source of data is the <a
href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/">Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network (OPTN)</a>. The SRTR database consists of many
data tables with many components, including data on the transplant
waiting lists, the donor/recipient matching process, deceased donors,
living donors, and transplant recipients. The data dictionary, which
defines all available variables, can be found <a
href="https://www.srtr.org/requesting-srtr-data/saf-data-dictionary/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>We began by exploring the dataset and available variables to
investigate changes in the transplant landscape over time. We focused on
those listed with alcohol-related liver disease given the recent
increases in alcohol use in the United States and because it is now the
leading indication for liver transplantation.</p>
<p>We decided to break down the questions we asked into 3 key areas:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What are the outcomes for patients placed on the organ
waitlist?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the characteristics of organ recipients?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the characteristics of organ donors?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="evolution-of-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Evolution of Questions</h2>
<p>As our project evolved, we delved into more in-depth questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does sex impact waitlist mortality?</li>
<li>What are the donor and recipient demographics and do donors
frequently match recipients in age and race?</li>
<li>Does the donor type impact patient recipient outcomes?</li>
<li>For recipients who experienced graft failure, is there a difference
in the time to graft failure based on donor type?</li>
<li>Among transplants with graft failure, what is the distribution of
patients who received multi-organ transplants compared to single organ
liver transplants?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>We used two of the large datafiles available:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>CAND_LIIN</code> includes persons who are registered on the
OPTN waiting list and presents information about candidates during the
time they are waiting to receive an organ.</p></li>
<li><p><code>TX_LI</code> includes characteristics of the patient at the
time of transplant and the transplant operation itself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The data was cleaned using RStudio/RMarkdown to meet the following
criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every observation required a unique identifier
(<code>PERS_ID</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>All patients had to be over the age of 18 age
(<code>CAN_AGE_AT_LISTING</code> and <code>REC_AGE_AT_TX</code> &gt;=
18)</p></li>
<li><p>Dates must be saved in correct date format
(<code>REC_TX_DT</code>, <code>CAN_LISTING_DT</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Only patients with an alcohol-related diagnosis code were
included. Those with alcohol-related cirrhosis had <code>CAN_DGN</code>
4215, 4216 and those with acute-alcohol related hepatitis had
<code>CAN_DGN</code> 4217.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluation or transplant should have occurred after the year
2020, the year when transplants for alcohol-related hepatitis became
more widely adopted. (<code>REC_TX_DT</code>,
<code>CAN_LISTING_DT</code> &gt;= 2020).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>Demographic and clinical characteristics at listing—including age,
MELD score, race/ethnicity, and diagnostic subtype—were summarized
overall and stratified by sex. Additional subgroup tables describe
individuals separately with alcohol-related cirrhosis and acute
alcohol-related hepatitis. Continuous variables are reported using
medians and interquartile ranges, and categorical variables using
frequencies and percentages. These tables illustrate differences in
listing severity, demographic composition, and raw waitlist mortality
across clinical subgroups. Group comparisons in descriptive tables were
assessed using non-parametric tests for continuous variables and
χ²-based methods for categorical variables, with p-values provided to
summarize evidence of between-group differences. T</p>
<p>Kaplan–Meier curves were generated to compare waitlist survival
between men and women. Each curve reflects time from listing to waitlist
death, with censoring at transplant, administrative removal, or end of
follow-up. Confidence bands depict uncertainty in the estimated survival
probabilities, and log-rank testing evaluates whether survival differs
by sex. These plots summarize the cumulative risk of waitlist mortality
over time and highlight potential sex-based disparities.</p>
<p>In addition to clinical characteristics and waitlist outcomes,
demographic patterns of transplanted donor–recipient pairs were examined
to explore factors that may influence equity in transplant access. Age
distribution visualizations showed that recipients tended to be older
than their donors, with recipients displaying a narrower age range.
Living donor transplants demonstrated slightly larger donor–recipient
age gaps than deceased donor transplants, reflecting greater reliance on
younger family members as donors.</p>
<p>Recipient patient outcomes were also observed using the incidence of
graft failures and patient status at the last follow-up. Across
transplants with living donors and deceased donors, there was a similar
distribution of each category of patient status. The most frequent
patient status at the last follow up was “Living”. A subsample of the
ALD cohort was created to identify transplants with graft failure. The
time to graft failure was computed from the time between the transplant
date and the graft failure date. This graft failure subsample was
stratified by donor type and also by transplant type. It was found that
there was a greater prevalence of single-organ liver transplants than
multi-organ transplants.</p>
<p>Racial distribution analyses revealed that both donor sources and
transplant recipients remain predominantly White, with racial minority
groups—including Black/African American, Asian, American Indian/Alaska
Native, and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander patients—representing
substantially smaller proportions of transplant activity. A
donor–recipient race matching matrix, heat map, further illustrated that
exact race-matching is most frequent among White and Black/African
American pairs, while opportunities for matched transplantation are
limited among smaller minority racial groups. Together, these
demographic findings highlight systemic disparities that may influence
transplant eligibility, donor matching, and ultimately access to
life-saving treatment.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Below we have outlined a few limitations in our analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Limited capture of social determinants of health</em>: Key
factors known to influence transplant access and outcomes—such as
socioeconomic status, education, social support, and structural barriers
to care—are not comprehensively represented in the dataset. As a result,
we are unable to assess the role of social inequities in access to
transplant and recovery.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Incomplete and inconsistently reported data</em>: As we
originally perused the data sets, we noted that several variables
contained missing or the values were not recorded in the data
dictionary, particularly in race, cause-of-death, and donor
mechanism-of-death fields. This may introduce classification uncertainty
and reduce statistical power in subgroup comparisons.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cross-sectional nature of donor–recipient matching
metrics</em>: These analyses that describe demographic matching rely on
observed donor–recipient pairs. Therefore, they do not capture the
underlying pool of available organs or candidates at match-run time,
limiting inference regarding access disparities.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Our exploratory analyses provides context regarding the demographic
landscape of liver transplantation in the United States for patients
suffering from Alcohol-related Cirrhosis or Acute Alcohol-related
Hepatitis. Recipients tended to be older than donors, reflecting the
progression of liver disease to the point of transplantation and the
younger age at which donor death or living donor eligibility typically
occurs. Racial distribution plots showed that White individuals comprise
the majority of both the donor and recipient populations, while minority
racial groups remain underrepresented. The donor–recipient race matching
heatmap further illustrated that match likelihood is highest among White
and Black/African American individuals but substantially lower for other
racial groups. These findings suggest that disparities in donor
availability may reinforce inequities in transplant access for
historically marginalized populations.</p>
<p>The ALD cohort shows demographic and clinical differences by sex,
with women listed at younger ages and with slightly higher MELD scores,
particularly in alcohol-related cirrhosis. Despite these baseline
differences, waitlist mortality did not differ between men and women in
either cirrhosis or acute alcohol-related hepatitis. This suggests that
sex-based disparities in disease severity at listing do not translate
into short-term differences in mortality risk after listing.</p>
<p>Among the graft failure subsample, there was a lower proportion of
multi-organ transplants than liver only transplants. There were no
multi-organ transplants from living donors that experienced graft
failure. Findings also revealed that there was a greater number of
single-organ liver transplants with graft failure among recipients with
a deceased donor compared to those with a living donor. Visualizations
of graft failure times revealed that the median time between the
transplant date and graft failure was greater for transplants with
deceased donors than that of transplants from living donors. The
differences between patient outcomes across donor types should be
interpreted with the consideration that there was a greater sample of
transplants from deceased donors compared to those with living
donors.</p>
<p>Our results align with expectations that clinical urgency drives
listing and waitlist survival outcomes, but they also highlight
structural demographic constraints that extend beyond clinical severity.
The observation that sex-based clinical differences at listing do not
translate into mortality differences suggests relative equity in
waitlist management practices. However, the persistent demographic
imbalance in who ultimately receives a transplant underscores the
importance of ongoing efforts to improve donor recruitment and organ
allocation policies that support equitable access across racial and
demographic groups.</p>
<p>Among alcohol-related liver transplant recipients, median donor age
was significantly higher in cirrhosis cases compared with acute
alcohol-related hepatitis (Wilcoxon rank-sum test p &lt; 0.001),
suggesting meaningful differences in donor sourcing between etiologies.
In addition, donor type varied significantly between groups (Chi-square
p &lt; 0.001), indicating that the likelihood of receiving an organ from
a living versus deceased donor may differ by clinical presentation of
alcohol-related disease. Limitations: This analysis reflects observed
associations but cannot infer causality due to its cross-sectional
design. Diagnostic coding may misclassify etiologies, donor
characteristics may be incompletely recorded, and sample sizes for
certain subgroups may limit precision. External generalizability is
constrained by reliance on U.S. transplant registry data, and unmeasured
determinants such as disease severity, center-level policies, and
socioeconomic factors were not captured.</p>
